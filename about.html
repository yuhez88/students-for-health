                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Students for Health is founded by a group of students at Veritas Academy in New York.
                    We are dedicated to making health information easier to find and discuss.
                    We connect our community with trustworthy resources and aims to foster a culture
                    of support, care, and awareness through peer-led outreach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each month, we design concise, easy-to-understand flyers on topics such as reproductive health,
                    mental wellness, and affordable care—distributed across schools, libraries,
                    and community centers. We also host monthly online discussions where anyone can ask questions,
                    share experiences, or simply listen in.
                </p>

                I probably would’ve never heard about GoodRx if it wasn’t for Students for Health.
                I was able to help my grandma save a lot of money on one of her prescriptions after trying it out.
            </p>

            <p class="testimonial">
                I’d always thought about starting birth control for different reasons, but I was too intimidated to
                start the process. Students for Health helped me take the first step by encouraging
                me to call and book an appointment with a doctor.
