                <h2>Flu Season & Vaccination</h2>
                <h3>What is the flu vaccine?</h3>
                <p>The flu vaccine is a shot that protects you from the <strong>influenza</strong> virus, known as flu.
                </p>
                <h3>When should you get it?</h3>
                <p>Ideally, it is best to get the vaccination in early fall (September to October).</p>
                <h3>What are the costs?</h3>
                <p>If you are covered by insurance, you can get a flu shot at your doctor’s office, local pharmacies,
                    and
                    urgent care clinics.</p>
                <h4>What if you are not covered by insurance?</h4>
                <p>If you are uninsured, you can get a <strong>free or low-cost</strong> flu vaccination through
                    community
                    clinics or public
                    health departments.</p>

                <h3>Healthy Eating Tips</h3>
                <p>1️⃣ <b>Add Frozen or Canned Vegetables to What You Already Eat</b></p>
                <p>Frozen and canned veggies are affordable, last longer, and just as nutritious as fresh ones. Instead
                    of
                    stopping ramen completely, try adding frozen broccoli into your ramen while it boils!</p>
                <p>2️⃣ <b>Add a Fruit or Vegetable to Just One Meal a Day</b></p>
                <p>Instead of eliminating fast food, next time you get a burger, add a side salad or bring an apple with
                    it.
                    Bananas, apples, carrots, and cucumbers are some of the most affordable produce items year-round.
                </p>
                <p>3️⃣ <b>Add Plant-Based Proteins like Beans and Lentils</b></p>
                <p>Beans and eggs are budget-friendly protein powerhouses. Try adding them into meals you already make.
                    Dry
                    lentils and canned beans cost under $1 per serving and are high in fiber, protein, and nutrients.

                        medications</strong>,

                    if you don’t
                    have insurance. It works by providing <strong>free coupons</strong> you can use to get lower prices
                    on
                    medications.</p>
                <p>Usually, GoodRx can’t be combined with insurance, but <strong>you can choose whichever price is
                        lower,
                        your
                        copay or
                        the GoodRx price</strong>. You can ask the pharmacist: “Can I use this coupon instead of my
                    insurance?”.

                <h3>How to Use GoodRx</h3>

                    quantity.</p>
                <p>3️⃣ <b>Compare prices</b></p>

                <p>Click on a coupon and you can either print it, email it to yourself, text it to your phone, or just
                    take
                    a
                    screenshot.</p>

                <h2>Emergency Contraception: What Is It & Where to Get It</h2>
                <h3>What is Emergency Contraception?</h3>
                <p>Emergency contraception (EC) is a safe and effective backup method to help prevent pregnancy after:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unprotected sex</li>
                    <li>Birth control failure (for example, broken condom)</li>
                    <li>Missed birth control pills</li>
                    <li>Sexual assault</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It does not end an existing pregnancy. Emergency contraception is NOT an abortion pill. It works by
                    delaying
                    ovulation.</p>
